# Problems students do in CS 1420
These problems/projects are mostly the same as what stduents would do in CS 1400 and CS 1410. However, there are some divergences.

Mainly it seems that one project per week may be a little too much for students, so we dropped one from 1400 and one from 1410. 
* Timmy the Turtle is not used in CS 1420. It's here because we cloned it from CS 1400.
* TaskManager is not used in CS 1420. It's here because we cloned it from CS 1410.
